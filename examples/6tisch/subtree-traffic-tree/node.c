/**
 * \file
 *         Smoke-test node for the autonomous implicit-ack tree scheduler
 *         (os/services/orchestra/orchestra-rule-implicit-ack.c), extended
 *         with hop-by-hop in-network aggregation of the application traffic
 *         itself.
 *
 *         Motivation: RELAY_TX shards (see orchestra-rule-implicit-ack.c)
 *         give any one parent-child relationship at most a fixed, small
 *         multiplier (ORCHESTRA_IA_RELAY_TX_SHARDS) of extra capacity. Near
 *         the root, traffic fans in from an entire subtree, and subtree size
 *         grows with network size -- so past some scale, some node's
 *         aggregate arrival rate exceeds what any fixed multiplier can
 *         drain, and packets are dropped at the TSCH queue (tsch_queue_add_
 *         packet() failing outright, "can't send packet ... queue 128/128"),
 *         not at the radio. Adding more parallel cells cannot fix this in
 *         general; the fix here instead reduces how many separate
 *         transmissions are needed to move the same amount of application
 *         data, by combining multiple nodes' tiny reports into one frame per
 *         hop instead of relaying each one individually.
 *
 *         Every non-root node still originates its own periodic report
 *         exactly as before, but instead of addressing it directly to the
 *         root (which stock 6LoWPAN/RPL would then transparently forward,
 *         hop by hop, entirely below the application), it now always
 *         addresses its own current aggregate to its own immediate RPL
 *         parent, and every node -- not just the root -- terminates and
 *         inspects the UDP payload it receives: it unpacks whatever reports
 *         a child just relayed, folds them into its own outgoing aggregate
 *         buffer alongside its own report, and periodically flushes that
 *         combined buffer as a single packet to its own parent. The root is
 *         simply the node for which "next hop" has no further hop: it
 *         unpacks and logs each item instead of forwarding it onward. This
 *         only ever changes application-layer packet counts and payload
 *         sizes -- it does not touch ROOT_ADJACENT, UPLINK, RELAY_TX,
 *         SELF_OVERHEAR, or the implicit-ack confirmation mechanism, all of
 *         which keep operating exactly as before on whatever the
 *         application now hands them.

/* Aggregation parameters. Each item is (origin node id, origin's own

 * added latency (how long an item may sit in an intermediate node's buffer
 * before being forwarded) against how many items typically get bundled into
 * one outgoing frame.
 *
 * MAX_AGG_ITEMS was originally set to 16 (49 wire bytes) purely to stay
 * comfortably clear of one 802.15.4 frame's usable payload after 6LoWPAN/
 * IPv6/UDP compression overhead. Measurement at 100/150 nodes showed that
 * value was actually far too conservative for a different reason entirely:
 * "IATRACE agg overflow-drop" (add_item()'s forced drop-oldest fallback,
 * originally meant only for the rare bootstrap case of no route yet) was
 * firing thousands of times over a single run -- 6357 times at 100 nodes --
 * driven by "IATRACE agg defer-global" (the node-wide TSCH packet pool
 * being full) firing *8071* times, meaning the underlying congestion
 * routinely outlasted a 16-item buffer's capacity to simply wait it out.
 * Raising this to 24 (73 wire bytes, confirmed fragmentation-free) let
 * PDR nearly double at 100 nodes (20.2%->39.4%) and more than double at 150
 * (10.5%->23.2%), simply by giving pending items more headroom to survive a
 * sustained congestion episode without being dropped. 32 (97 wire bytes)
 * was also tried and made things much worse (150 nodes: 23.2%->8.4%): it
 * crosses the actual single-frame payload budget once 6LoWPAN/IPv6/UDP
 * headers are added, confirmed by 6LoWPAN fragmentation appearing in the
 * log (1071 occurrences, versus zero at 24) -- a fragmented aggregate needs
 * every fragment to arrive for the whole batch to reassemble, turning one
 * lost frame into a lost aggregate instead of one lost item. 24 is the
 * validated sweet spot: as large as tested without crossing into
 * fragmentation, and already a large, measured win over the original,
 * overly-conservative value. */

 * attempt is essentially guaranteed to be wasted or, worse, contend for the
 * one slot that frees up right as some other node's packet also arrives.
 * Smoothing it into an EWMA instead answers a different, more useful
 * question -- "has this link been *trending* congested over the last
 * several flush cycles" -- which is what we actually want in order to
 * decide how much to risk bundling into a single frame *before* the queue
 * is already full, not just react once it is. EWMA_SHIFT=3 gives new
 * samples 1/8 weight (~8 flush cycles, ~40s, to mostly settle to a new
 * steady state) -- smooth enough to ignore one-off blips, responsive enough

 * buffered, bounded by MAX_AGG_ITEMS, until we do).
 *
 * Critical correctness point: simple_udp_sendto() is fire-and-forget --
 * uip_udp_packet_sendto() never reports back whether the underlying
 * tsch_queue_add_packet() (the MAC-layer per-neighbor ring buffer) actually
 * accepted the frame or rejected it outright ("can't send packet ... queue
 * 128/128", logged deep in TSCH, invisible up here). Clearing the buffer
 * unconditionally after every send call -- the first version of this file
 * did exactly that -- meant that every such rejection silently discarded
 * this entire aggregate at once, up to MAX_AGG_ITEMS reports in one shot,
 * rather than the single report an unaggregated design would have lost in
 * the same circumstance. That is a real, measured amplification: it is
 * exactly why aggregation regressed at 100/150 nodes, precisely the scales
 * where this queue is already most often full, rather than helping there
 * the way it does at 25-60. We instead check both the neighbor's own
 * current queue occupancy *and* the global packet pool (tsch_queue_add_
 * packet() can fail on either: the per-neighbor tx_ringbuf, or the single
 * node-wide packet_memb/queuebuf pool shared across every neighbor -- the
 * "queue %u/%u %u/%u" in TSCH's own "can't send packet" log is exactly
 * these two counts side by side, and checking only the first one turned out
 * to leave this fix a complete no-op: at 100 nodes the global pool, not the
 * per-neighbor one, was the one actually saturated) before committing to
 * the send, and defer (leave the buffer intact for the next tick) if either
 * is already full, turning a guaranteed silent multi-report loss into, at
 * worst, added latency. */
