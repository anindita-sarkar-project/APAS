/**
 * \file
 *         Autonomous parent/child TSCH cell scheduling, WITHOUT implicit
 *         acknowledgment and WITHOUT the dual (short/regular) timeslot
 *         template -- every cell here is a completely standard TSCH cell,
 *         using the regular timeslot template and TSCH's normal,
 *         synchronous, explicit-ACK confirmation/retry logic unchanged.
 *
 *         SIZING RULE (deliberately simple): every node allocates cells with
 *         its OWN parent sized by (that node's own direct RPL child count)
 *         + 1 for its own traffic. Nothing deeper than direct children is
 *         ever tracked, estimated, or signaled -- no grandchild addresses,
 *         no per-grandchild shard counts, no RPL routing-table traversal at
 *         all. A node's own direct child is relaying an entire subtree
 *         behind it, however deep -- but from this node's point of view
 *         that is one relationship, sized once, not one relationship per
 *         descendant.
 *
 *         This replaces an earlier design (see git history/session notes)
 *         that instead estimated each relay relationship's traffic from the
 *         RPL storing-mode routing table -- a true whole-subtree traffic
 *         proxy, but one that fluctuates on every DAO/route change anywhere
 *         in a node's entire subtree. That value needed to be signaled one
 *         hop (parent needs to know a child's exact shard count to size a
 *         matching Rx cell) and changed far faster than the EB channel
 *         carrying it could keep up with at scale, and every one of a dozen
 *         different attempts to close that gap (faster signaling, larger
 *         receive-side headroom, hysteresis, dedicated slotframes, ...)
 *         made things worse, not better. Own-child-count is a far more
 *         stable quantity -- it only changes when this node's own set of
 *         direct RPL children actually changes, a comparatively rare
 *         topology event -- so the same one-hop EB signaling that failed for
 *         the old metric should be adequate for this one.
 *
 *         Every child of a given parent gets its own dedicated cell(s),
 *         HASH2(parent, child) + shard spreading, rather than sharing one
 *         position Orchestra-style -- but there is only ever one such
 *         relationship per direct child, never one per descendant.
 *
 *         The own-shard-count signal reuses the same children-list Enhanced
 *         Beacon Information Element orchestra-rule-implicit-ack.c already
 *         defines (see MLME_SHORT_IE_TSCH_IA_CHILDREN, frame802154e-ie.c),
 *         piggybacking one byte per direct child -- that byte used to carry
 *         a 0/1 has-descendants flag there, and here instead carries this
 *         node's own current shard count. No framer, tsch.c, or tsch.h
 *         change was needed to support this reuse -- see this file's own
 *         TSCH_CALLBACK_IA_OWN_CHILDREN/TSCH_CALLBACK_IA_CHILD_EB
 *         definitions below.
 *
 *         Every other TSCH_CALLBACK_IA_* hook that orchestra-rule-implicit-
 *         ack.c wires up is either unneeded here (grandparent discovery,
 *         congestion-adaptive confirmation deadlines: both exist solely to
 *         support implicit-ack, which this file does not use) or must still
 *         be defined as a harmless stub purely to satisfy tsch.h's
 *         unconditional auto-wiring under TSCH_WITH_IMPLICIT_ACK=1 (needed
 *         only for the children-list IE above) -- see the "unused IA
 *         callback stubs" section near the end of this file. Critically,
 *         TSCH_CALLBACK_IMPLICIT_ACK_ACTIVE() always returns 0 here, which
 *         by itself is sufficient to keep every other piece of the
 *         implicit-ack machinery in tsch-slot-operation.c permanently
 *         dormant regardless of TSCH_WITH_IMPLICIT_ACK's value: every one of
 *         those code paths is gated on PACKETBUF_ATTR_MAC_ACK having been
 *         left unset for a given frame, which never happens when this
 *         function always returns 0 (see send_packet(), tsch.c, and the
 *         do_wait_for_ack computation in tsch_tx_slot(),
 *         tsch-slot-operation.c). No cell installed by this file ever calls
 *         tsch_ia_link_use_short_timing() either, so every cell also keeps
 *         the regular, full-length timeslot template by construction.
 *
 *         CG_CONF_EWMA_SHARD_COUNT (default 0, off): a build-time comparison
 *         variant that replaces direct adoption of a child's EB-reported
 *         shard count with a Q8 fixed-point EWMA of it, installing the
 *         rounded average instead of the raw report -- see
 *         cg_child_eb_input()'s own comment for the mechanism and the
 *         expected trade-off this is designed to measure.

 *     documented at the top of this file and used for every result in the
 *     companion paper's main evaluation.
 *
 *   - EWMA-smoothed prediction (CG_EWMA_SHARD_COUNT=1): run every reported
 *     value through a Q8 fixed-point exponential moving average and install
 *     the *rounded* average instead of the raw report. The event that
 *     triggers a look (an EB arriving) is unchanged; only what is done with
 *     the value once received changes. Asymmetric by default (see
 *     CG_EWMA_ATTACK_SHIFT/CG_EWMA_DECAY_SHIFT above): a first, symmetric
 *     version of this (equal smoothing in both directions) measurably
 *     regressed delivery ratio and topology stability at 25+ nodes,
 *     structurally the same trade the paper's own Attempt 10 (commit-after-
 *     2s-of-consistent-readings hysteresis) already made and found to
 *     regress -- because symmetric smoothing delays a shard-count *increase*
 *     exactly as much as a decrease, and only the former has a correctness
 *     cost. The asymmetric version below adopts increases immediately
 *     (matching direct adoption's behavior for the dangerous direction) and
 *     only smooths decreases, which are safe to delay. */
