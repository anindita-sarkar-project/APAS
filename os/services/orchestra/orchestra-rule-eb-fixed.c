 *         Orchestra: a single EB slot, fixed and identical on every node,
 *         instead of orchestra-rule-eb-per-time-source.c's per-address hash.
 *
 * Diagnosed root cause this replaces: eb_per_time_source's new_time_source()
 * recomputes a receiver's EB-listening timeslot as hash(new_time_source_addr)
 * % ORCHESTRA_EBSF_PERIOD every time TSCH's time source changes (which
 * tsch_rpl_callback_parent_switch() ties directly to every RPL preferred-
 * parent switch). Confirmed in testing: a node whose parent flapped between
 * two candidates twice within ~90s had its EB-listening slot relocated twice
 * in that window and, despite each relocation correctly matching the new
 * target's own fixed Tx slot on paper, never actually received a single EB
 * from either candidate for 240+ real seconds -- double
 * TSCH_DESYNC_THRESHOLD -- and was forcibly disassociated by tsch.c's
 * "last sync" desync-timeout, which in turn forced RPL to nullify its
 * parent. Root cause: every parent switch (or churn of the two switching
 * back and forth) throws away however much time was already invested
 * relocking onto the old target, restarting the acquisition clock from
 * zero, indefinitely, if the churn keeps happening faster than a full
 * re-lock completes.
 *
 * Fix: don't tie the EB slot to *who* the time source is at all. One fixed
 * (timeslot, channel_offset), identical on every node for both its own EB Tx
 * and its Rx listening, network-wide -- the same convention already used by
 * default_common's and orchestra-rule-implicit-ack.c's l_control cells (see
 * their own comments), extended here to the EB slotframe itself. A parent
 * switch no longer moves anything: the listening position was never a
 * function of the parent's address to begin with, so there's nothing to
 * re-acquire. LINK_OPTION_SHARED's usual per-occurrence random backoff is
 * what keeps multiple nodes' own periodic EB transmissions (already staggered
 * by TSCH_EB_PERIOD's own random jitter, see tsch.c) from colliding on this
 * now-common slot -- the same tolerance default_common's shared cell already
 * relies on for arbitrary contending unicast/broadcast traffic.
 *
 * Data-plane traffic (this project's own UPLINK/RELAY_RX/RELAY_TX/
 * ROOT_ADJACENT cells in orchestra-rule-implicit-ack.c) is untouched by this
 * file and stays pair-wise hash-derived (HASH2/HASH3 of the specific
 * sender/receiver addresses) exactly as before -- only the EB control-plane
 * slot moves to a fixed, network-wide-common position.
