/**
 * \file
 *         Orchestra: an autonomous, ASFN-rotating tree scheduler with implicit ACKs.
 *
 *         A child overhears the frame its parent forwards on to the grandparent and
 *         treats it as an implicit ACK of its own earlier uplink transmission, since
 *         both child and grandparent are within the parent's Tx range. Cell placement
 *         is autonomous (no control-packet exchange): parent and child independently
 *         compute the same SlotOffset/ChannelOffset from a hash of their addresses and
 *         the current ASFN (Absolute Slotframe Number = ASN / TSCH_IA_SFS_SIZE), so the
 *         hash rotates every slotframe cycle and address collisions between different
 *         node pairs don't persist indefinitely.
 *
 *         Cells (all in the short slotframe "sf_short", except ROOT_ADJACENT; no
 *         longer ASFN-rotating -- see ia_hash1_shard()'s own comment for why):
 *           UPLINK           Tx to parent            HASH(parent)   -- receiver-based,
 *                                                     shared by every sibling with the
 *                                                     same parent (see update_uplink())
 *           RELAY_RX         Rx from any direct       HASH(self)    -- one cell shared by
 *                             child                                  every child, mirrors
 *                                                                     stock Orchestra's own
 *                                                                     receiver-based Rx cell
 *                                                                     (update_relay_rx_shared())
 *           RELAY_TX[child]  Tx to parent, relaying   HASH3(self, child, parent) -- kept
 *                             a child's frame onward   per-child (see struct ia_child)
 *           ROOT_ADJACENT    Tx to a 1-hop root       HASH(root)    -- receiver-based
 *                             (regular timing, explicit ACK -- root has no further
 *                             grandparent, so no frame terminating at it can ever be
 *                             confirmed implicitly, whether self-originated or relayed)
 *
 *         This milestone (M1) installs all of the above and rotates them every ASFN,
 *         but every cell still uses the regular timeslot timing and synchronous
 *         explicit ACKs -- the implicit-ack overhear/deferred-confirmation machinery
 *         and the short timing template are added in later milestones.
 *
 *         Known M1 limitation: a node only learns of its own direct children (via
 *         child_added/child_removed) and its own RPL parent/grandparent-of-root
 *         status; it has no way yet to learn about grandchildren relayed by a
 *         non-root parent (that needs the grandparent/children-tags EB IE, added in
 *         a later milestone). RELAY_TX is therefore only installed when our own
 *         parent is not the root -- any frame destined directly to a root (whether
 *         self-originated or relayed by us) always takes the ROOT_ADJACENT path
 *         instead, which every root already listens for via its own per-child Rx
 *         cells (installed below when tsch_is_coordinator). This means topologies no
 *         deeper than 2 hops from the root (root - 1-hop - 2-hop) are fully handled
 *         by this milestone; a relay through a non-root intermediate (3+ hops from
 *         root) is not yet correctly received until the EB IE milestone lands.

 *    25-node:  PDR 72.7%->68.5%, RDC 1.29%->1.76%   (both worse)
 *
 *   TSCH_IA_SFS_SIZE=17 (the short-slotframe collision scenario rotation
 *   specifically targets -- "not able to re-synchronize" event counts and
 *   RDC in parentheses):
 *    25-node:  PDR 24.9%->27.8% (marginal), RDC 30.3%->5.6% (much better),
 *              resync-fail 217->69, disassoc 157->54, real parent-switches
 *              7->19 (churn roughly tripled)
 *    60-node:  PDR 26.9%->17.6% (worse), RDC 63.4%->13.7% (much better),
 *              resync-fail 600->453 (only modestly better), disassoc
 *              262->258 (unchanged), real parent-switches 23->41 (churn

 *
 * So the diagnosis was correct -- rotation does resolve the specific
 * permanent-collision-with-l_control mechanism, and RDC/resync-failure
 * counts confirm it convincingly at every scale tried -- but it introduces
 * a new cost of its own: every cell relocating once per ASFN (~170ms at
 * SFS_SIZE=17) compounds with this topology's existing RPL rank flapping
 * into substantially more real parent switches, and each switch still
 * carries the usual reconvergence cost (see PARENT_SWITCH_THRESHOLD_CONF's
 * comment). That new cost erases most of the PDR upside at 25 nodes and
 * outweighs it entirely at 60 -- and, more importantly, regresses the
 * already-good SFS_SIZE=101 configuration the paper's own results are built
 * on, at both scales tried. Reverted back to the static, non-rotating hash
 * below on that basis: a fix that resolves its target mechanism but costs
 * more than it saves isn't a net improvement, however cleanly it isolates
 * the original diagnosis. Left as a known limitation rather than pursued
 * further (e.g. rotating less often than every ASFN, or only rotating the
 * specific cells most likely to collide with l_control) without a concrete
 * next hypothesis to test.
 *
 * Single-address hash, folding in a shard index so ORCHESTRA_IA_UPLINK_
 * SHARDS distinct positions can exist for the same address instead of one
 * (shard 0 reduces to the plain, unsharded hash this rule used before
 * ORCHESTRA_IA_UPLINK_SHARDS existed) -- see update_relay_rx_shared()'s
 * comment for why: a parent installs one Rx cell per shard, and each child
 * deterministically picks one shard (uplink_shard_for(), based on the
 * child's own address, so it never changes on a parent switch) for its own
 * UPLINK. This splits however many children share one parent across
 * ORCHESTRA_IA_UPLINK_SHARDS separate CSMA-contention groups instead of one,
 * directly addressing the "duplicate retransmission" cost of a single
 * shared cell (see ORCHESTRA_IA_UPLINK_SHARDS's comment in orchestra-
 * conf.h) at a small, fixed (not per-child) increase in cell count -- still
 * O(1) in the number of children, just a larger constant than plain
 * consolidation's 1. 2654435761 is Knuth's multiplicative hash constant
 * (2^32 / golden ratio): multiplying the shard index by it before adding
 * spreads different shards' results across the full 32-bit range rather
 * than clustering them near each other, so ia_slot()/ia_channel()'s modulo
 * reduction doesn't correlate shard 0 and shard 1's positions. */

 * hash-derived cell tag (works, but ties control traffic's queue position

 * always-regular slotframe with its own hash-derived cell (broke: its
 * formula was bit-identical to UPLINK's own, HASH2(parent,self)+asfn, so it
 * permanently aliased UPLINK's cell and always lost the tie-break -- see
 * git history). A *fixed* position sidesteps both: it never rotates, so it
 * can never permanently alias a hash-derived cell (at most it occasionally
 * coincides with one that happens to hash to 0, tolerated like any other
 * autonomous collision), and it needs no new slotframe/handle to win a
 * tie-break against.
 *
 * LINK_OPTION_TX|RX together (not just Tx, like UPLINK/ROOT_ADJACENT) since
 * this same fixed slot must also serve as our Rx opportunity for any child's
 * control traffic addressed to us -- unlike RELAY_RX, this isn't scoped to
 * one specific child, so one generic Rx-capable cell covers all of them.
 * Every node's sf_short/sf_root share the same size and ASN phase, so
 * timeslot 0 lands on the same absolute ASN network-wide; LINK_OPTION_SHARED
 * (with its usual backoff) is what keeps that from being a hard collision
 * every single occurrence -- this is the same tradeoff the standard 6TiSCH
 * minimal schedule's own single shared cell already makes, and control
 * traffic (trickle-timer DIO, periodic DAO refresh) is infrequent enough
 * for it to matter little in practice.
 *
 * Fixed at (1,0), not (0,0): default_common's own shared cell (a different,
 * same-size slotframe, handle 2) is unconditionally hardcoded to (0,0) too.
 * tsch_schedule_get_next_active_link()'s tie-break picks purely by
 * link_options/slotframe_handle, decided before either link's queue is even
 * looked at (tsch-schedule.c) -- when both links have LINK_OPTION_TX, the
 * lower slotframe_handle always wins. sf_short's handle (1) is lower than
 * default_common's (2), so an l_control placed at (0,0) would permanently
 * win that tie-break on every non-root-adjacent node (whose l_control lives
 * in sf_short, Tx+Rx) -- not an occasional collision resolved by
 * LINK_OPTION_SHARED backoff like the cross-node case below, but a
 * deterministic, every-single-cycle starvation of default_common, since
 * neither cell ever rotates. Confirmed in testing: a non-root-adjacent
 * node's queued DIOs sat in the TSCH queue forever, 0 ever reaching the
 * radio, silently blocking every node further down the tree from ever
 * hearing a DIO from it. Root-adjacent nodes were never affected -- their
 * l_control lives in sf_root instead, leaving only the Rx-only
 * l_control_rx at sf_short's fixed slot, which *loses* the same tie-break to
 * default_common's Tx-capable cell (Tx beats non-Tx) -- masking the bug
 * until a 2+-hop node's own l_control was exercised. (1,0) has no such
 * structural collision with any other fixed-position cell in this file.
 *
 * Deliberately addressed directly to orchestra_parent_linkaddr/root_linkaddr
 * (not tsch_broadcast_address, unlike default_common's own shared cell):
 * tsch_queue_get_unicast_packet_for_any() -- the mechanism that lets a
 * broadcast-addressed shared cell also serve arbitrary unicast traffic --
 * explicitly skips any neighbor with tx_links_count > 0, and our parent
 * always has at least one (UPLINK or ROOT_ADJACENT), so a broadcast-
 * addressed cell would never find our queued control packet at all. Direct
 * addressing means this cell's Tx side shares the exact same physical
 * per-neighbor queue as UPLINK/ROOT_ADJACENT -- safe only because
 * tsch_queue_get_packet_for_nbr() (tsch-queue.c) now scans past a
 * mismatched head to find and promote a matching-tag packet, rather than
 * only ever checking the literal head position; without that fix this would
 * reintroduce the exact head-of-queue starvation this session already found
 * and fixed once (see git history).
 *
 * Unlike UPLINK/ROOT_ADJACENT, this cell does *not* wait for
 * orchestra_parent_knows_us: that gate exists because the *parent's own*
 * matching Rx cell for us is only installed once our route exists
 * (child_added(), triggered by our DAO's ACK) -- a genuinely one-sided
 * problem for a per-neighbor hash-derived cell. This cell has no such
 * problem: every node installs its own generic (1,0) Rx-capable cell as
 * soon as it merely knows its own parent/root, regardless of whether its
 * children (if any) have DAO'd yet -- so our very first DAO, sent before
 * orchestra_parent_knows_us is even true, can safely ride this cell too,
 * instead of falling back to default_common's much rarer opportunity. */

     * attempt -- they only fall back to the link's live field when the tag
     * is exactly 0xffff. But relay_tx/l_uplink's timeslot and channel_offset
     * are mutated every single ASFN tick (orchestra_ia_new_asfn(), ~170ms).
     * A packet queued at one ASFN keeps trying to send on that ASFN's
     * (timeslot, channel) long after the live cell has rotated elsewhere:
     * confirmed in testing by a packet's logged retries showing an identical
     * channel_offset across many seconds (frozen) while a live-value trace
     * showed the same link's channel_offset cycling every ~170ms the whole
     * time, and by retries only recurring roughly once per full SF(S)size-
     * epoch cycle (~2.9s at the default size 17) -- i.e. only when the hash
     * sequence happened to wrap back to the frozen value. Leaving these
     * unpinned means tsch_queue_get_packet_for_nbr()'s per-link check always
     * passes (packet_attr_timeslot == 0xffff short-circuits the comparison)
     * and tsch_get_channel_offset() always falls back to the link's live,
     * current channel_offset -- so every transmission attempt, on whichever
     * cell occurrence actually runs it, uses that cell's real current
     * position instead of a stale enqueue-time snapshot. *slotframe is still
     * pinned since slotframe handles don't rotate and this keeps the packet
     * correctly scoped to the right Tx role -- sf_short for our own UPLINK,
     * or this specific child's own relay_tx_sf for a relay (a *different*

   * time-source change as a parent change and recomputes/reinstalls every
   * cell keyed off orchestra_parent_linkaddr accordingly -- silently
   * hashing every one of this node's own cells (UPLINK, RELAY_TX, SELF_
   * OVERHEAR) against a neighbor RPL never chose and has no record of.
   * Confirmed at 100-node scale: 57 of 66 logged "re-synchronizing on"
   * events picked an address different from the node's own current RPL
   * preferred parent at that moment -- and it doesn't self-heal, since
   * RPL's own dag->preferred_parent pointer never actually changed, so
   * rpl_set_preferred_parent()'s unconditional early-return (dag->
   * preferred_parent == p) means the one callback that would otherwise fire
   * again and correct it never does; the node's cells stay hashed against
   * the phantom neighbor for the rest of the run. Verified concretely: a
   * child's SELF_OVERHEAR position recomputed via HASH3(phantom_parent,
   * self, grandparent) exactly, rather than HASH3(real_rpl_parent, self,
   * grandparent) -- the two disagree in both timeslot and channel, and the
   * real parent's own RELAY_TX naturally still uses its own correct
   * address, so the two sides of what's supposed to be one cell relationship
   * silently diverge with no error, no timeout, and no self-correction.
   *
   * Checked every IA_BOOTSTRAP_CHECK_PERIOD (4/s, same timer as the
   * bootstrap check above): if orchestra_parent_linkaddr has drifted from
   * RPL's own preferred parent, correct *only* our own address bookkeeping
   * via reconcile_parent_address() -- deliberately not touching TSCH's
   * actual time source (tsch_queue_update_time_source()) at all. First
   * attempt did exactly that (forcing TSCH's real sync target back onto
   * RPL's address too) and measured *worse* at 100 nodes (PDR 60.7%->48.1%,
   * disassoc 16->33): resynchronize() picks "last neighbor we could
   * actually hear an EB from" precisely because the node just lost sync
   * with something else, likely including the RPL parent itself in
   * marginal-link conditions -- forcibly redirecting the radio-level sync
   * target back onto a neighbor the node may not currently be able to
   * track pushed it back out of sync again, compounding the very problem
   * that mechanism exists to recover from. Correcting only *our own* cell
   * bookkeeping avoids that entirely: TSCH keeps syncing its clock to
   * whoever it can actually hear (its own legitimate job), while every IA
   * cell still gets hashed against the address RPL actually routes
   * through -- the one thing that was actually wrong.
   *
   * Full 6-scale validation (PDR, on top of ORCHESTRA_CONF_COMMON_SHARED_
   * PERIOD=11 above, library-default-31 baseline for reference):
   *
   *   scale     31 (orig)   11 alone   11 + this fix
   *      8        99.8%       99.8%       99.8%   (flat -- no churn)
   *     25        74.9%       73.4%       87.4%   (large win)
   *     49        77.3%       92.2%       88.4%   (gives back a little, still far above orig)
   *     60        71.1%       81.2%       80.6%   (flat)
   *    100        39.4%       60.7%       64.0%   (win)
   *    150        14.7%       10.6%       38.9%   (large win -- beats even the manual
   *                                                 SFS_SIZE=167 override above, 31.1%,

   *
   * Every scale improves or holds flat versus the original baseline; only
   * 49 gives back some of period=11-alone's own gain. Kept permanently.
   *
   * Hysteresis (requiring the divergence to persist before correcting) was
   * tried afterward and reverted -- see the long comment on the now-removed
   * IA_PARENT_RECONCILE_DELAY above for the full measured sweep. It did cut
   * disassociations substantially, but PDR was lower at every delay tried,
   * at both 100 and 150 nodes, than this plain, unconditional, immediate
   * version below -- disassociations were never the thing actually costing
   * PDR, so trading them down by waiting only left cells wrong for longer.
   * Correct as soon as a divergence is seen, every check_parent_knows_us()

 * subtree saw overhear-match-but-nothing-pending rates of 45-63%, while
 * leaf nodes (no subtree at all) saw 3-7% -- tracking subtree size, not
 * network size, and not explained by (and not fixed by lengthening) the
 * confirmation deadline, which only makes the shared queue backlog worse
 * (measured: PDR 88.3%->56.9%, timeout rate 29.9%->57.1% at 8 nodes/SF=101
 * under ORCHESTRA_CONF_IA_CONGESTION_ADAPTIVE). Disambiguation requires
 * actually reading who the original sender was.
 *
 * Deliberately minimal and fail-closed: handles SAM 00/01 (a full or
 * 64-bit-IID address inline, under either link-local or context-based
 * compression -- SAC only changes where the elided *prefix* comes from,
 * never the explicit-IID byte count or position, except at SAM=00 where
 * the two modes disagree and are handled separately below), covering the
 * long-address traffic this rule's own examples always produce. Any other
 * case (a 16-bit short address, context-SAM=00's reserved encoding, a
 * malformed or truncated header) returns 0 -- "cannot determine" -- and
 * the caller must treat
 * that exactly like "not a match": failing to confirm a genuinely-own
 * packet costs one extra retry (the existing timeout path already handles
 * that), but a false positive would silently and permanently lose a
 * different packet's confirmation, which is the one outcome this must
 * never risk. */
